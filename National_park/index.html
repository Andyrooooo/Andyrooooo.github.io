            <p>Bears are large mammals that eat mostly 
                meat and fish. Many bears also eat plants, 
                bulbs, and insects.
                The polar bear eats mostly meat and is 
                classified as carnivores, while the panda feeds 
                almost entirely on bamboo and is classified as 
                a herbivore. The six other species of bear eat 
                both plants and animals and are classified as 
                omnivorous.</p>
